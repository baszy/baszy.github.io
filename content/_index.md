Hello, I'm Basile Stathopulos. I'm a computer enthusiast. Computer graphics is
my passion, but I am also currently interested in operating systems, programming
languages, and analog hardware.

Most of my software projects are for learning purposes. Some of them can be found
on [my Github](github.com/baszy). Please check them out-- I hope you find them
cool or useful.
