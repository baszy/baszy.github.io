# Personal website

The source code for my static content website. Does not have proper mobile
device support, but it should display nicely at any sane display size. See the
site at [baszy.github.io](https://baszy.github.io).

Note that some of the content (my resume) is required to display the site
correctly and is pulled as a [submodule](https://www.github.com/baszy/resume).
